Question 1:
By running the code "var gl = c.getContext('webgl')" one is able to get a 3d canvas.
This will give access to the webgl API which allows for 3D rendering. 

Question 2:
A circle can be drawed on the canvas with the following code found on w3school:
      canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
      var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
      var radius = 30;
      var centerX = canvas.width / 2;
      var centerY = canvas.height / 2;
      
      context.beginPath();
      context.arc(centerX, centerY, radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI, false);
      context.fillStyle = 'blue';
      context.fill();
      context.lineWidth = 5;
      context.strokeStyle = '#003300';
      context.stroke();

An arc is firstly drawn then filled with coloour.

Question 3:
const myArray = ["Norawy", "Sweden","Norar"];
var myArrayFiltered = myArray.filter(myFunc =  (x) =>{if(x[0] == "N") {return x;}}) ;
console.log(myArrayFiltered.length);
console.log(myArrayFiltered);

This code filters the list on elements starting with "N". Pasing a function which returns the element that has a N in the start.
